This project was produced by Ayoub Ammy-Driss, a student at ENSAE. 
The aim of this project was to reproduce and try to improve the results of the paper 'Implied volatility directional forecasting a machine learning approach'. This paper is available in this folder.

The ml4pmt folder contains the .py files used during the course.
The Hurst Notebook explains the calculation and the interest of adding the hurst exponent in the dataset.
Backtest_Incremental.py contains the explanation of the strategies and their implementation as well as the training implementation of the algorithms used in the article. 
Finally the main notebook contains the code that you only need to run to test 2 algorithms and see the results of the strategies.
An .html version of the Main and Hurst notebooks are available to view the results.
